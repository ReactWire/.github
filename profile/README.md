## What is ReactWire ?

It's my take on livewire, applied on react native.

## Why ?

Imagine a word in which you build react native apps just with laravel livewire-like components.

## How ?

Inspired by [LiveWire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) and [this tutorial series](https://laracasts.com/series/livewire-uncovered), with the help of [react-jsx-parser](https://github.com/TroyAlford/react-jsx-parser).

## Status

My first step was a small proof of concept to find out how can we turn a string from the backend in react-native components.
Here is a expo demo: https://snack.expo.dev/@andreitelteu/reactnative-jsx-parser---app-builder
